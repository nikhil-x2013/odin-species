     <h2>Description:</h2>
     <p>
        The most famous food in Bihar, liti choka is a dish close to many a heart.
        This is a must have in Bihar just like Dal Bafla(in M.P) and Dal Bati  in Rajasthan. 
        Some people also call it baati chokha or chokha bati. You could actually call all 
        of them as cousins. All of the baati are made with wheat flour over coal. Nowadays, 
        you can bake them at home on an oven grill. Only, the curry served differs. 
        While we serve the dal bati and dal bafla with lentils, this Bihar street food 
        comes with vegetable mash. Another prominent feature is mustard oil. The mode of 
        cooking changes from ghee in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan to mustard oil in Bihar food. 
        Thus, changing from dairy to vegan.
