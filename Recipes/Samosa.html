     <h2>Description :</h2>
     <p>
        Samosas are deliciously fried or baked pastries that are
      popular in many parts of the world. They typically 
      contain a mixture of mashed potatoes, peas, onions, and spices,
       and can be served with chutney or yogurt.

        Traditionally, samosas are triangular in shape. However,
        they vary considerably in size, from bite-sized morsels to large substantial creations.
        Key to the samosa’s popularity is its versatility; this is a food 
        with many forms. Fillings range enormously—from potato with ginger and 
        garlic to cauliflower, spiced lamb mince, minced fish, and chicken—and 
        can be mild, fragrant with aromatic spices, or formidably hot, laced with green 
        or red chilies. A crisp flaky pastry coating is characteristic, but the pastry 
        can also vary in texture.
